By parsing output from luac program, generate tags file.
The result is better than files from ctags.

note: the nested functions and anonymous functions are removed.

sample usage:
one file:
 > lua lua_tags ../test/simple.lua > tags
more files:
 > lua lua_tags ../test/*.lua > tags
check if it works:
 > lua lua_tags test
